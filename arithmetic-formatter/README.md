Create a function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. The function should optionally take a second argument. When the second argument is set to True, the answers should be displayed. The solution can be found in arithmetic_arranger.py.

Some examples of expected results can be found below :

```
  11      3801      1      123         1
+  4    - 2999    + 2    +  49    - 9380
----    ------    ---    -----    ------
  15       802      3      172     -9379
```
